#About
This blender plugin has been developed as a modernization of the now very dated [blender plugin created by dan & Brent & Oygron](https://github.com/Oygron/SupCom_Import_Export_Blender) 
and everybody who [forked](https://github.com/Oygron/SupCom_Import_Export_Blender/network/members) it. 
The original plugin does not work on blender 2.80+ anymore and the API changes although somewhat transferable broke the plugin.
Also, to be fair, the code quality is very very poor. 

I used the old plugin as a reference and rewrote it from scratch making sure it works on the latest versions of blender (2.82).

#What can it do
The plugin can load *Supreme Commander Model* (.scm) and *Supreme Commander Animation* (.sca) files. 
You can then edit these in Blender and export them again. 

#License
This plugin is released under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) license.
